## What is My Agenda?

* Built using rails in the backend and the ERB template engine for serverside rendering, My Agenda is an application giving users the ability to create tasks to manage their time more efficiently. Users are able to sign up and save their tasks to their profile, and have full CRUD functionality to modify those tasks.

## Technical Discussion

* Bcrypt was used for authentication purposes. It allows users to log in and out while giving them the ability to access their tasks while keeping their passwords securely kept through Bcrypts hash and salt technologies.

# Technologies Used
* Rails 
* Heroku
* Active Record
* Bcrypt 
* Ruby 
* Bootstrap
* CSS 
* HTML
* ERB

## Going forward

* I would like to work on the css and further complete the design portion of this assignment.
